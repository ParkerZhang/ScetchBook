The Big Picture: A Payment System for Swaps


Imagine you’re building a system to handle payments related to financial transactions called “swaps”. This system uses a few important tools:



FileProcessorConfig: This is like a watchful guard, constantly looking at a specific folder (the “in” folder in /home/data/) to see if there are any new files.

FileService: When the guard finds a new file, it passes it on to FileService, which takes the file and processes it.

Data Service: This is the heart of the payment processing. It:

Reads CSV records: These are data files that look like spreadsheets, containing information about the payments.

Turns data into “Payment” objects: It takes the information from the CSV files and organizes it into neat, easy-to-use “Payment” objects.

Sends Payments to Kafka: Kafka is like a high-speed message bus. Payments are sent here so they can be processed by other parts of the system.

Keeps track of batches: It also sends messages to a special Kafka topic to track how many payments are being sent in groups.




Creating Payment Objects


To make sure the payment data is organized correctly, the system uses a tool called Avro (a way to define data structures). Here’s how it works:



Compiling a Schema: A special command (java -jar c:\avro\avro-tools-1.11.3.jar compile schema payment.avsc .) is used to create a blueprint for the payment data (like defining columns in a spreadsheet).

Adding Features: The payment objects are also given the ability to read data from CSV files (CsvBindByName) and convert themselves to JSON format (toJson). This makes them easy to work with in different parts of the system.


Communicating with Other Systems



Sending to Kafka: A special address (http://127.0.0.1:8080/sendKafka?message=your_message) is used to send messages to Kafka.

Sending to IBM MQ: The system can also communicate with IBM MQ, another messaging system. There are dedicated addresses for sending greetings (http://127.0.0.1:8080/sendMQ) and even sending payment data (http://127.0.0.1:8080/payMQ). In the latter case, MQ processes the payment data and then sends it to Kafka.


Security and Secrets



HashCorp Vault: A tool called HashCorp Vault is used to store sensitive information, like passwords, in a secure way.

Startup and Secrets: A script (local_run_vault.bat) starts Vault, and another script (set_secret.bat) is used to securely add passwords or other sensitive information.

Overriding Properties: Vault allows the system to use secure passwords for connecting to Kafka and other systems (like spring.kafka.properties.jaas.username=xxxx and spring.kafka.properties.jaas.password=xxxx).


Putting it All Together:


This is a simplified version of the code snippets you provided. It describes the core functionalities of a payment processing system for financial swaps. This system uses a combination of tools, such as FileProcessorConfig, FileService, Data Service, Kafka, IBM MQ, and HashCorp Vault, to handle payment data securely and efficiently.

Abstract
This document outlines the design and functional principles of a payment processing system specifically tailored for financial transactions known as “swaps.” The architecture incorporates a series of components that work in concert to facilitate the efficient handling of payment data, ensuring secure communication and proper data management.


1. Overview of the Payment Processing System
   The payment processing system employs several key components:


1.1 FileProcessorConfig
This component operates as an observer, systematically monitoring the directory located at /home/data/in for the presence of new files. Upon detecting a new file, it triggers the subsequent processing steps.


1.2 FileService
Upon receiving a new file, the FileProcessorConfig forwards it to the FileService. This service is responsible for the initial stages of file processing.


1.3 Data Service
The Data Service constitutes the core functionality of the payment processing system. It encompasses the following operations:



CSV Record Loading: The service ingests CSV files containing payment information, which are organized in a tabular format analogous to spreadsheets.

Creation of Payment Objects: The data is transformed into structured entities referred to as “Payment” objects, facilitating organized data manipulation.

Transmission to Kafka: The Payment objects are subsequently dispatched to Kafka, a distributed event streaming platform, which acts as a high-throughput messaging system for further processing.

Batch Messaging: Concurrently, batch messages are relayed to a dedicated Kafka control topic to monitor group transactions.


2. Creation of Payment Objects
   To ensure the proper representation of payment data, the system leverages the Avro framework. The following steps are involved in this process:



Schema Compilation: The command java -jar c:\avro\avro-tools-1.11.3.jar compile schema payment.avsc . is executed to generate a schema definition that specifies the structure of the payment data.

Integration of Features: Payment objects are enhanced with functionalities such as the CsvBindByName annotation for CSV data mapping and a toJson method for converting Payment objects into JSON format, thus ensuring compatibility with various system components.


3. Inter-System Communication
   The system facilitates communication with external services using the following defined endpoints:



Kafka Messaging: Messages can be sent to Kafka through the endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8080/sendKafka?message=your_message.

IBM MQ Interaction: Similarly, the system interfaces with IBM MQ, allowing the transmission of greeting messages via http://127.0.0.1:8080/sendMQ and the dispatch of payment data through http://127.0.0.1:8080/payMQ. In this latter scenario, the MQ Consumer processes the payment records before forwarding them to Kafka.


4. Security and Secret Management
   To manage sensitive information, the system utilizes HashCorp Vault, which provides a secure method for handling secrets.


4.1 Vault Initialization
The Vault is initiated using the script local_run_vault.bat.


4.2 Secret Configuration
The process of establishing secrets involves executing the script set_secret.bat. This allows the application to override specific properties, such as:



spring.kafka.properties.jaas.username=xxxx

spring.kafka.properties.jaas.password=xxxx


5. Conclusion
   This document presents a streamlined interpretation of a payment processing system designed for financial swaps, elucidating the architecture that integrates the components of FileProcessorConfig, FileService, Data Service, Kafka, IBM MQ, and HashCorp Vault. The outlined system underscores a cohesive approach to securely managing and processing payment data.


6. Reference
   The URL https://confluent.cloud/environments/env-w1drdj/clusters/lkc-2yj601/topics/my-topic/overview refers to the Confluent Cloud platform, a managed Kafka service that facilitates the management and monitoring of Kafka topics and their respective data flows.

Secure and Efficient Payment Processing System for Financial Swaps


Abstract
The financial services industry has long grappled with the challenge of securely and reliably processing payments associated with complex financial instruments like swaps. Here we present a novel payment processing system architecture that integrates cutting-edge technologies to address this critical need. Our solution leverages a unified framework of file monitoring, data transformation, message queueing, and secrets management to facilitate the end-to-end handling of swap-related payments.


System Architecture
The core of our payment processing system consists of several interconnected components (Fig. 1). FileProcessorConfig acts as a sentinel, continuously monitoring a designated directory (/home/data/in) for new files. Upon detecting a new file, it seamlessly hands off the data to the FileService for further processing.


The Data Service forms the heart of the system, responsible for the complex task of translating raw payment data. It ingests CSV records, converts them into structured Payment objects, and then dispatches these objects to a Kafka distributed messaging system for downstream consumption. Crucially, the Data Service also publishes batch messages to a Kafka control topic, providing a auditable record of grouped transactions.


To ensure the proper formatting and handling of Payment objects, we leverage the Avro data serialization framework. Using the avro-tools utility, we compile a schema definition (payment.avsc) that specifies the structure of the payment data. The Payment objects are then enhanced with key functionalities, such as CSV data mapping (CsvBindByName) and JSON serialization (toJson), streamlining integration with other system components.


Secure Communication and Secrets Management
Recognizing the sensitivity of payment data, our system incorporates robust mechanisms for secure communication and secrets management. We enable two-way integration with external systems like IBM MQ through dedicated endpoints. For instance, users can submit payment data to the /payMQ endpoint, whereupon the MQ Consumer processes the records and forwards them to Kafka.


To safeguard sensitive information like Kafka credentials, we leverage the power of HashCorp Vault. This trusted secrets management platform allows us to securely store and retrieve sensitive parameters, such as spring.kafka.properties.jaas.username and spring.kafka.properties.jaas.password. The Vault is initialized using the local_run_vault.bat script, and secrets are provisioned via the set_secret.bat utility.


Conclusion
In this work, we have presented a comprehensive payment processing system tailored for the financial swaps domain. By seamlessly integrating file monitoring, data transformation, message queueing, and secrets management, our solution addresses the complex challenges of secure and efficient payment handling. This architecture lays the foundation for reliable and auditable processing of swap-related financial transactions, a critical requirement for modern financial institutions.
