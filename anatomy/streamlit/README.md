Using Streamlit with Ollama\! That's a great combination for building and deploying LLM applications. Here's a breakdown of how you can get started:

**What are Streamlit and Ollama?**

  * **Streamlit:** An open-source Python library that makes it easy to build and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. It's perfect for creating interactive interfaces for your LLM projects.
  * **Ollama:** A tool for running large language models (LLMs) locally on your machine. This allows you to experiment with and use LLMs without relying on external APIs or services.

**Why use them together?**

By combining Streamlit and Ollama, you can:

  * **Create interactive demos:** Build a web interface that allows users to interact with your locally hosted LLMs.
  * **Develop custom applications:** Design specific applications that leverage the power of LLMs for tasks like text generation, summarization, or question answering.
  * **Experiment with different models:** Easily switch between different LLMs hosted by Ollama and compare their performance within your Streamlit app.

**Getting Started**

1.  **Install Ollama:** Follow the instructions on the Ollama website ([https://ollama.ai/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://ollama.ai/)) to download and install Ollama on your system.

2.  **Pull a model:** Use the `ollama pull` command to download the LLM you want to use. For example, `ollama pull llama2` will download the Llama 2 model.

3.  **Install Streamlit:** If you don't have it already, install Streamlit using pip: `pip install streamlit`

4.  **Create a Streamlit app:** Write a Python script that uses Streamlit to create your web interface and the `ollama` Python package to interact with your LLM. Here's a basic example:

<!-- end list -->

```python
import streamlit as st
from ollama import Ollama

st.title("My LLM App")

ollama = Ollama()

user_input = st.text_area("Enter your prompt")

if st.button("Submit"):
    with st.spinner("Generating response..."):
        response = ollama.generate(model="llama2", prompt=user_input)
        st.write(response['response'])
```

5.  **Run your app:** Use the command `streamlit run your_app_name.py` to start your Streamlit app.
