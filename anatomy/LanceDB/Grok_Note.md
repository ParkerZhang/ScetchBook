Here's a step-by-step guide to create a simple application that reads documents from a folder, saves them to a vector database like LanceDB, and uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Ollama and DeepSeek locally:

### Prerequisites:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Ollama** installed on your system for running DeepSeek R1 locally.
- **LanceDB** for vector storage (you'll need to install LanceDB).
- **LangChain** for orchestrating the RAG pipeline.
- **Necessary Python libraries** (`langchain`, `lancedb`, `ollama`, etc.)

### Steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install langchain langchain-community lancedb ollama 
   pip install pypdf
   pip install unstructured
   ```

2. **Prepare Your Document Folder:**
   - Ensure you have a folder with documents (e.g., PDFs, text files) you want to process.

3. **Python Script:**

   Here's a basic Python script to perform these tasks:

   ```python
   import os
   from langchain_community.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader, PyPDFLoader
   from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
   from langchain_community.embeddings import OllamaEmbeddings
   from langchain.vectorstores import LanceDB
   from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
   from langchain_community.llms import Ollama

   # Load documents from a folder
   folder_path = "./documents"
   loader = DirectoryLoader(folder_path, glob="**/*.pdf", loader_cls=PyPDFLoader)
   docs = loader.load()

   # Split documents into chunks
   text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
   documents = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)

   # Create embeddings (assuming you've set up Ollama with DeepSeek R1)
   embeddings = OllamaEmbeddings(model="deepseek-r1:7b")

   # Store embeddings in LanceDB
   db = LanceDB.from_documents(documents, embeddings, connection="lancedb://localhost:5000")

   # Setting up the RAG system with DeepSeek R1
   llm = Ollama(model="deepseek-r1:7b")
   retriever = db.as_retriever(search_type="similarity", search_kwargs={"k": 4})
   qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, chain_type="stuff", retriever=retriever)

   # Example query
   query = "What are the main topics discussed in the documents?"
   result = qa.run(query)
   print(result)
   ```

### Explanation:
- **Document Loading**: We're using `DirectoryLoader` to load PDFs from a specified folder. Adjust the `glob` pattern to match your file types.
- **Text Splitting**: Chunks the documents into manageable pieces for embedding.
- **Embeddings**: Uses `OllamaEmbeddings` with DeepSeek R1 for creating vector representations of the document chunks.
- **Vector Storage**: LanceDB is used here to store these vectors. Make sure LanceDB is configured to run locally.
- **RAG Setup**: Combines the retrieval mechanism from LanceDB with DeepSeek R1 to answer queries.

### Notes:
- **Ollama Setup**: Ensure you have Ollama installed and have pulled the DeepSeek R1 model (`ollama pull deepseek-r1:7b`).
- **LanceDB Configuration**: You might need to start a LanceDB server locally or connect to an existing one.
- **Adjust Parameters**: You might need to fine-tune `chunk_size`, `chunk_overlap`, or the number of retrieved documents (`k`) for better performance.

This script provides a foundational structure. Depending on your specific needs, you might want to add error handling, improve document parsing for different formats, or expand the interaction capabilities (like creating a user interface with Streamlit).
